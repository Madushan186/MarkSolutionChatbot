# MARK SOLUTION CHATBOT - RUN INSTRUCTIONS

Follow these steps to run the project locally on your machine.

## PREREQUISITES
1. **Python 3.10+** (for Backend)
2. **Node.js & npm** (for Frontend)
3. **Ollama** (for AI Model) -> Installed and running

---

## STEP 1: START OLLAMA (AI ENGINE)
Open a new terminal window and run:
ollama serve

(Keep this running in the background)

---

## STEP 2: SETUP & START BACKEND
Open a NEW terminal window (Terminal #2):

1. Navigate to the backend folder:
cd backend

2. Install Python dependencies (only need to do this once):
pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Start the Backend Server:
uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

(You should see "Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000")

---

## STEP 3: SETUP & START FRONTEND
Open a NEW terminal window (Terminal #3):

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
cd frontend

2. Install Node dependencies (only need to do this once):
npm install

3. Start the React App:
npm start

(This will automatically open http://localhost:3000 in your browser)

## HOW TO STOP THE PROJECT

### Method 1: Standard Stop
Go to each of the 3 terminal windows and press:
**Ctrl + C**

### Method 2: Force Stop All
If you want to close everything instantly, open a terminal and run:
pkill -f "uvicorn"; pkill -f "node"; pkill -f "ollama"

## TROUBLESHOOTING
- If Backend says "Address already in use", use **Method 2** above to clear the ports.
- If Frontend shows a blank page, check the Terminal #3 for errors.
